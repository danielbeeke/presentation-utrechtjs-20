OpenGroup, A WebRTC fueled social group system.

We will talk about two things: the start of the internet & OpenGroup a WebRTC fueled social system. 

It starts with how people coming together made a huge decentralized web of systems. Originally for the military, companies and universities, now called the internet and accessible for everybody. The internet has become more centralized and more controlled by huge organisations over the years, this calls for more decentralized applications. Build the decentralized web!

Second part will be about one of those decentralized applications:  OpenGroup, a WebRTC fueled social system with an open plugin architecture. A social group system like Whatsapp or Facebook (chat) groups but without a company behind it to harvest the data. OpenGroup has a functional prototype but is not finished yet. There is a lot to be built. We will talk about the engine of OpenGroup: WebRTC, about the highly modular structure, testing p2p connections, VueJS, ES6 and a lot more.
