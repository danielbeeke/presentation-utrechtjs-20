### The internet, open &<br>decentralized from the start.

Early networks that grew into the internet.

* ARPANET _1973_
* X.25 _1976_
* NSFnet _1985_

note: 
    
    ARPANET was created for sharing the expensive power computers of the military.
    Technology wasn't as advanced as today and things broke a lot.
    So the ARPANET needed to be decentralized to maintain stability.
      
    X.25 was used in Europe, it is a network system still used today for payment transactions.
     
    NSFnet was originally created to connect researchers to the NSF funded super computing centers.
    After a while it developed into a major part of the internet backbone.
